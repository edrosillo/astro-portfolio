# Welcome to the Blog

This is the first post on my new portfolio website. I decided to rebuild my online presence to better reflect my style: **Modern Tech with a Retro Soul**.

## Why Astro?

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) because it's incredibly fast. It ships zero JavaScript by default, which means this site loads instantly.

## The Design

I wanted something that felt professional but not boring. The **Electric Cyan** accents and **Dot Grid** texture give it that "cyberpunk-lite" feel without being overwhelming.

Stay tuned for more updates on my projects and design process!
